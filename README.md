# Drone_Controller_IDS_Assignment
This project was created by the joint effort of Athanasios Kandylas and Dylan Rayner, valid for the course Interactive Digital Systems for the 2019 fall semester at Roskilde University.

The purpose of this project was to create a functioning remote controller using an ESP32 board, through which the user can send commands to a Tello drone. The controller incorporates the use of digital and analogue inputs (four buttons, a joystick and a potentiometer) and digital outputs (two LEDs). A checkpoint was also created, consisting of an Esp32, a light sensor and a strip of ‘NeoPixels’, which will change color once the drone has landed.
